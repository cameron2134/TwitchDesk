# TwitchDesk
Latest version, changes and downloads can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/cameron2134/TwitchDesk/releases/latest">Releases</a> page



## Description
TwitchDesk is a Java application designed to allow users to view twitch.tv streams from their desktop with minimal effort.



## Installation
There is very little to do to make TwitchDesk functional, simply extract the contents of the .zip into a folder, ensure the supplied .exe (or .jar, depending on which version you downloaded) is in the same folder as the 'res' and 'data' folders, then run the .exe or .jar. If the application cannot automatically determine your Livestreamer install directory, you will be prompted for manual entry. Once Livestreamer has been found, you will be asked to authorize the application, then you're good to go!


## Requirements
In order to use TwitchDesk, you will need:

* <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html">Java Runtime Environment 8</a> (x64 only, does not work with x86 yet)
* Have <a href="https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer/releases>Livestreamer"</a> installed on your system
